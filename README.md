**Crack Your Internship Challenge 🚀**

Welcome to my dedicated journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through the "Revise with Arsh" 45-day challenge! This repository documents my progress as I tackle 4-5 DSA questions daily, based on the curated DSA sheet.

**About the Challenge 📈**

The DSA Sheet curated by Arsh includes around 270-280 questions frequently asked in interviews and assessments at top tech companies. My goal is to enhance my DSA skills and prepare for upcoming internships and placements.

**My Goals 🎯**

    Solve 4-5 questions daily
    Complete the DSA sheet within 45-60 days
    Stay accountable by updating my progress here

**How to Use This Repository 📂**

    Each day's solutions will be organized in separate folders named Day X.
